1. What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the UI when data changes.

2. Why React?

Component-based → Reuse UI blocks

Virtual DOM → Faster performance

One-way data flow → Easy debugging

Large community & ecosystem

Easy to integrate with other libraries

3. What is JSX?

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
Example:

const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;


JSX is later converted into JavaScript by Babel.

4. What are side effects in React?

A side effect is any operation that affects something outside the component’s scope.
Examples:

Fetching data from an API

Manipulating the DOM directly

Setting up a timer

We handle side effects using the useEffect() hook in React.

5. What is the Virtual DOM?

The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM.
React uses it to detect what parts of the UI changed, and only updates those parts in the real DOM — improving performance.

6. What is Babel?

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that converts modern JS (ES6+, JSX) into browser-compatible JavaScript.
Example: Converts JSX → React.createElement().

7. What is the V8 Engine?

V8 is Google’s JavaScript engine (used in Chrome and Node.js) that compiles JavaScript directly into machine code, making it run very fast.

8. What is CRA (Create React App)?

CRA is an official React project setup tool that automatically configures:

Webpack

Babel

Development server

File structure

Command:

npx create-react-app myapp

9. What is Vite?

Vite is a modern build tool and dev server that is faster than CRA because it uses ES modules and lazy loading.
It’s lightweight and commonly used for React, Vue, etc.

Command:

npm create vite@latest myapp

10. Difference: CRA vs Vite
Feature	Create React App	Vite
Speed	Slower (Webpack)	Much faster (ESBuild)
Build Tool	Webpack	ESBuild/Rollup
Default Config	Heavy	Lightweight
Hot Reload	Slower	Instant
Usage	Beginner-friendly	Modern alternative
11. HTML vs React Webpage
Aspect	HTML Page	React Page
Structure	Static	Dynamic (JS Components)
Rendering	Browser renders HTML	React uses Virtual DOM
Reusability	Less	High (components)
Interactivity	Manual JS	Built-in with state/hooks
Maintenance	Difficult	Easy due to modular design
12. React vs Angular
Feature	React	Angular
Type	Library	Framework
Language	JavaScript (JSX)	TypeScript
DOM	Virtual DOM	Real DOM
Data Binding	One-way	Two-way
Learning Curve	Easy	Complex
Speed	Faster	Slightly slower
Developed By	Facebook	Google
13. Library vs Framework
Feature	Library	Framework
Control	You call the library	Framework calls your code
Example	React, jQuery	Angular, Django
Flexibility	High	Low (fixed structure)
Size	Small	Large
Use	Add specific features	Full application structure
14. What are components in React?

Components are independent, reusable pieces of UI.
Types:

Functional Components (use functions + hooks)

Class Components (older, use lifecycle methods)

15. What is useState Hook?

useState allows React components to have state (data that changes over time).
Example:

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

16. What is useEffect Hook?

useEffect handles side effects like data fetching, API calls, and timers.
Example:

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component Mounted");
}, []);

17. What is a Single Page Application (SPA)?

An SPA loads one HTML page and dynamically updates the content using JavaScript — without reloading the page.
React apps are SPAs.

18. How does React Router work?

React Router helps in navigating between components without reloading the page.
Example:

<Route path="/about" element={<About />} />

19. What is a key in React lists?

Keys help React identify which list items changed or moved.
Example:

{items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}

20. What are props in React?

Props are inputs to a component — they make components reusable.
Example:

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello {props.name}</h1>;
}
